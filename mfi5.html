      <img src="bird and dragon.jpg" alt="Painting" style="width:640px;height:315px;">
      <p>I like this image because I was interested in the fierceness of the dragon and bird. The two figures probably represent Suzaku and Seiryu who are deities. If I had to animate this photo I would have it that when you hover over the picture the dragon and bird fight over the sphere.</p>

      <img src="Archery competition.jpg" alt="Painting" style="width:640px;height:312px;">
      <p>I liked how this painting looked because the fiures seem to feel as if they are preparing for a competition. If i animate this photo I would have an arrow shoot across the page to where the mouse is.</p>

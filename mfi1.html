    <h2>My Favorite Internet</h2>

    <h3><a href="http://www.filippobello.com/portfolio">animated website</a><h3>
    <p>I liked this website because it made you feel apart of it.The way the website is made makes you think you are in your own world.I liked that when your mouse hovered on a link or video you could tell the difference.Although at times it was confusing of what you could click on the page.</p>

    <p>This site was very confusing. Every picture was a link and the page was so full of pictures it was overwhelming.this images looked nice but once yu put your mouse over the image it was interrupted by a link.I did not like how this site was set up.</p>
